Ai used: Chatgpt

How I Used It: I asked ChatGPT to help me come up with object ideas for my MonoGame project and fix issues with github setup.
How It Helped: It helped me in understanding how to solve issues with mgcb editor.
What I Did Myself: I wrote down all the actual code for the project, designed the mechanism of how potions work and tested it. I also set up github and added my own comments and structuring.
